# Hi there, I'm Samuel Tseng! 👋

I'm a passionate software engineer dedicated to optimizing workflows and enhancing productivity. My toolkit revolves around a few key elements that help streamline my development process.

📝 One of my go-to tools is Vim, and you can find my meticulously crafted configuration files in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/vup815/dotfiles).

🚀 My love for automation drives me to use [ansible](https://github.com/vup815/ansible) to bootstrap my development environment, ensuring a consistent and efficient setup every time.

⌨️ Beyond Vim, I leverage [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/vup815/Adv360-Pro-ZMK) to configure multiple keyboard layers, boosting my productivity through custom layouts tailored to my workflow. Plus, I use the Dvorak keyboard layout instead of the traditional QWERTY, which further enhances my typing efficiency.

📚 I'm also an avid learner and document my journey in my [learning journal](https://github.com/vup815/learning_journal), where I focus on algorithms and data structures among other topics.

To summarize, I'm a developer deeply invested in refining my processes and tools to become as efficient as possible. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you share similar interests or have any questions!

✨ Let's connect and build something amazing together!
